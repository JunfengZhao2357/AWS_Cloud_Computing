# Cloud Computing Tools Implementation based on Golang 
## There are three projects all tested on AWS
* Designed, tested and launched my own custom web server called TritonHTTP using Go skills on AWS which supports multiple requests and responses on the same TCP connection;
* Designed and Implemented a Network File sharing service called Surf-Store like Dropbox with Remote Procedure Call in Golang; Handled the clients’ inconsistent file conflicts by adding version number for each file stored in Surf-Store;
* Created and tested a distributed key-value store based on Amazon’s DynamoDB on AWS;
